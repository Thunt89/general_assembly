# Group Project 1

## Learning Objectives

- Apply the skills learned so far on a previously unseen dataset
- Practise exploratory data analysis, dealing with missing data, and describing and plotting a dataset
- In a short time, gather and present your analysis and make recommendations for future work

## The Task

The year is 2017.

You work for a video games publisher who wants to understand the video games market in order to decide what to invest in for the future. They want to know things like:

- what genre of games are worth producing?
- what consoles should they target?
- who would their biggest rival publishers be in each genre or on each platform?
- what should their target market be (geographically)?

You have been given a dataset of **physical** video game sales from 1983 onwards to work with.

Explore and analyse the data and prepare a short presentation at the end.

Your target audience is **non-technical** stakeholders who want to understand the market to help inform their strategy.

### The Dataset

The data consists of ~16,000 rows and the following columns:

| Column | Description  | 
| ---    | ---    |
| Rank | Games are already ordered by "total sales" |
| Name | The game's title
| Platform | The console the game was released on | 
| Year | The year the game was released on that console | 
| Genre | The game's genre | 
| Publisher | The game's publisher | 
| NA_Sales | Sales in North America (millions) | 
| EU_Sales | Sales in Europe (millions) | 
| JP_Sales | Sales in Japan (millions) | 
| Other_Sales | Sales elsewhere (millions) | 
| Global_Sales | Global sales (millions) |
