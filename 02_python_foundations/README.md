# Session 2: Python Foundations

## Objectives

**After this lesson, you will be able to:**
- Discuss Python as a programming language
- Define integers, strings, tuples, lists, and dictionaries
- Demonstrate arithmetic operations and string operations
- Demonstrate variable assignment
- Create loops, if-else conditions and functions
- Understand `Python` control flow and conditional programming.  
- Implement `for` loops to iterate through data structures.
- Apply `ifâ€¦ else` conditional statements.
- Create functions to perform repetitive actions.
- Combine control flow and conditional statements to solve the classic "FizzBuzz" code challenge.

## Misc.

Someone asked how to view the Jupyter notebook material as slides.

Open a terminal/cmd and navigate to the folder the notebook is in:

`jupyter nbconvert <your_file_name> --to slides --post serve`

So to run the first notebook:

`jupyter nbconvert 01_intro_to_python.ipynb --to slides --post serve`

This should automatically open the presentation in your browser. You can navigate with the arrow keys.

This functionality is built into Jupyter now, but under the hood it uses reveal.js, a Javascript framework. You can find out more here: [https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Articles-&-Tutorials](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Articles-&-Tutorials).
